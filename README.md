# Master's Degree Projects
Collection of projects carried out during the Master's Degree and evaluated for examination purposes. 

Each folder will correspond to an exam and will contain codes, presentations and reports (where required). 

All projects are done in Python or R, and the codes are collected in Notebooks for ease of reading and understanding.
